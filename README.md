Android Game(Currenlty working on)

This is a simple android game for picking 3 or 5 combination of cards that is equal to a target number from 4x4 boxes with 12 random numbers and 4 operators.
The rule is that the game shows 4x4 boxes for 5 seconds, and an user has to memorize 16 cards as much as they can. After 5 seconds,
all the cards are flipped and a target number is given. The user has to find combination from his/her memory.
Picking 3 cards is +1 point, and picking 5 cards is +2 point if the user declares for the double points.
